## 1) Goal
Generate a procedural mountain slope layout + data suitable for Godot 4.x.
Focus on natural flow, jump timing, corner rhythm, and casual-challenging balance.
The output must include:
- Height field or mesh data for the mountain
- A rideable path spline (Curve3D) that carves a realistic continuous line (no artificial ramps)
- Obstacle placements (rocks, trees) with safe/risk route logic
- Checkpoints with spacing aligned to time-attack pacing
- Metadata (length, vertical drop, slope angles, difficulty)

## 2) Style Reference (Lonely Mountains-like)
- Minimalistic low-poly mountain environment
- Natural continuous slope with gentle S-curves, cliffs, occasional drops
- Emphasize “flow riding”: readable line, rhythm, and risk/reward branches
- Lighting vibe: morning snow ambience

## 3) Technical Parameters (propose defaults if unspecified)
- Terrain length: ~1500 m (Z forward/downhill)
- Vertical drop: ~350 m
- Average slope angle target: 20–35°
- Terrain width: ~400 m
- Path width (rideable corridor): 4–6 m
- Mesh resolution (vertex spacing): ~2.0 m
- Checkpoints: every ~300 m (adjust last segment to finish line)
- Keep center line relatively clean of obstacles; push obstacles to shoulders

## 4) Gameplay Flow & Sections
- Start zone: short flat intro to build speed and teach steering
- Mid: branching segments (safe vs risky), alternating hairpins and rollers
- Final: steeper descent with 2 meaningful jumps and a committing line choice
- Place checkpoints at ~300 m intervals; ensure sightlines before bigger features

## 5) Output Format (STRICT)
Return a single JSON object with these top-level keys:

{
  "terrain": {
    "format": "heightmap",
    "origin": [0,0,0],               // world-space origin
    "cell_size": 2.0,                // meters per grid cell
    "width_m": 400,
    "length_m": 1500,
    "heights": [[...],[...], ...]    // 2D array rows along +X, columns along -Z
  },
  "path_spline": {
    "type": "Curve3D",
    "points": [[x,y,z], ...],        // center line in world coords, dense enough for smooth Curve3D
    "path_width_m": 5.0
  },
  "obstacles": [
    {"type":"rock","pos":[x,y,z],"scale":s},
    {"type":"tree","pos":[x,y,z],"scale":s},
    ...
  ],
  "checkpoints": [
    {"pos":[x,y,z], "radius": 2.5},
    ...
  ],
  "meta": {
    "slope_length_m": 1500,
    "vertical_drop_m": 350,
    "avg_angle_deg": 28,
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "theme": "frozen_morning"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Explain risk/safe routing logic and how it shapes flow.",
    "List two biggest jumps with approach speed & landing grade.",
    "Mention any sections designed to work well with FOV expansion & motion blur."
  ]
}

### Requirements for the JSON:
- All coordinates are consistent (Y up). Path points should hug carved terrain.
- Carve the terrain near the path (lower/flatten slightly) to suggest a natural line, not glued-on ramps.
- Keep obstacles > (path_width_m * 1.5) from spline center, except intentional risk apex objects (few).
- Ensure checkpoints sit slightly above local ground (y + 1.0~2.0).

## 6) Godot 4.x Integration Snippet (RETURN IN ADDITION to the JSON)
After the JSON, ALSO return a GDScript snippet that:
- Builds a MeshInstance3D “TerrainMesh” from the heightmap (ArrayMesh surface from a triangle grid).
- Adds a StaticBody3D with a ConcavePolygonShape3D generated from the same mesh for collisions.
- Creates a Path3D “RidePath” and populates it with a Curve3D using the provided points.
- Instantiates obstacles as MeshInstance3D children (use IcosahedronMesh for rocks, simple Cylinder+Cone for trees).
- Places checkpoints as TorusMesh (or thin Cylinder) at given positions.
- Adds TODO comments for connecting GPU particles, camera rigs, and speed/FOV effects per project.

Return EXACTLY in this order:
1) The JSON block (only the JSON, no code fences)
2) A single GDScript block named `apply_slope_data(data: Dictionary) -> Node3D` that consumes the JSON and returns a Node3D with children set up as described.

## 7) Quality Bar / Acceptance
- Natural, readable line with consistent downhill grade (no dead-flat plateaus nor uphill traps).
- At least 2 optional risk branches with tighter turns or gap jumps.
- Sightlines before big features; staging space before jumps.
- JSON validates as Godot-friendly numeric arrays; GDScript compiles without edits (placeholders allowed for meshes).
- Keep it minimalistic & low-poly; no textures are required.

## 8) Implementation Notes & Bug Fixes

### Critical Z-Offset Solution
**Problem**: Player was falling through terrain at start position because terrain Z range was [0, -1500] but player started at Z=0, leaving no ground in front.

**Solution**: Added `z_offset = 50.0` to extend terrain range to [+50, -1450]:
```gdscript
// In _generate_heightmap() and _build_terrain_mesh():
var z_offset = 50.0  # meters of terrain before start point
var world_z = origin[2] + z_offset - z * cell_size
```

This ensures terrain exists both in front of and behind the start point. Player spawns at approximately Z=-30 with 50m of terrain ahead.

### Current Implementation Architecture

**Files**:
- `scripts/terrain/terrain_generator.gd`: Core heightmap generation, mesh building, collision
- `scenes/environment/procedural_slope.gd/.tscn`: JSON loader and scene builder
- `resources/slope_data.json`: Terrain configuration data

**Key Technical Details**:
1. **Heightmap Generation** (`_generate_heightmap()`):
   - Nested loops create width_cells × length_cells grid
   - Base height: `350.0 * (1.0 - float(z) / length_cells)` for non-linear slope with varied sections
   - **Varied slope sections** for realistic ski slope experience:
     * 0-25%: Gentle starting area with smooth undulation (+10m variation)
     * 25-40%: First steep drop - moderate descent (-30m)
     * 40-55%: Gentle plateau with mild rolling (+5m variation)
     * 55-70%: Second steep section (-25m)
     * 70-100%: Final approach with gentle bumps (+8m variation)
   - **Smooth multi-layer noise** for natural terrain:
     * Large-scale features (mountains/valleys): freq 0.005, amplitude 8m
     * Medium-scale features (hills/dips): 2 layers, freq 0.012, amplitude 4m
     * Small-scale details (gentle bumps): 2 layers, freq 0.025, amplitude 2m
     * Fixed phase offsets prevent spiky terrain
     * Simplified frequency multipliers (0.5, 0.7, 0.8) for smooth transitions
   - Path carving: Reduces height near path points for smooth riding line
   - Z-offset: Critical 50m extension for terrain coverage

2. **Mesh Building** (`_build_terrain_mesh()`):
   - ArrayMesh with vertices, normals, UVs, and triangle indices
   - ConcavePolygonShape3D collision from mesh faces
   - Collision layers: StaticBody3D layer=2, Player mask=2

3. **Auto-Positioning** (`procedural_slope.gd`):
   - Reads start point from JSON path_spline.points[0]
   - Positions player at `start_point + Y+5.0 + Z-10.0`
   - Ensures player always starts above terrain

4. **Debug Tools**:
   - Red sphere markers at terrain corners for boundary visualization
   - Console logging for heightmap dimensions and collision face count

## 9) Difficulty System Design (Planned)

### Goal
Generate unique terrain for each playthrough with three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**.

### Difficulty Parameters

| Aspect | Easy | Medium | Hard |
|--------|------|--------|------|
| **Terrain Roughness** | 5-8m noise amplitude | 10-15m noise amplitude | 20-30m noise amplitude |
| **Slope Steepness** | 200m drop, ~8° avg | 350m drop, ~13° avg | 500m drop, ~18° avg |
| **Path Width** | 8m rideable zone | 5m rideable zone | 3m rideable zone |
| **Path Curvature** | Gentle S-curves, 10-15° max deviation | Moderate turns, 20-30° max deviation | Sharp hairpins, 40-50° max deviation |
| **Obstacle Count** | 5-8 obstacles | 15-20 obstacles | 30-40 obstacles |
| **Obstacle Distance** | 15-30m from path | 8-20m from path | 3-15m from path (some very close!) |

### Implementation Plan

**1. Create Difficulty Configuration** (`scripts/terrain/difficulty_config.gd`):
```gdscript
class_name DifficultyConfig

static func get_config(difficulty: String) -> Dictionary:
    match difficulty:
        "easy": return {
            "noise_amplitude": [5.0, 3.0, 1.5],
            "vertical_drop": 200.0,
            "path_width": 8.0,
            "turn_sharpness": 0.3,
            "obstacle_count_range": [5, 8],
            "obstacle_min_distance": 15.0
        }
        "medium": return { ... }
        "hard": return { ... }
```

**2. Modify TerrainGenerator**:
- Add `difficulty` parameter to `apply_slope_data()`
- Implement `_generate_procedural_path(difficulty_config, seed)`:
  - Use Perlin-like noise for natural curves
  - Scale turn sharpness based on difficulty
  - Ensure smooth transitions and no uphill sections
- Implement `_generate_procedural_obstacles(path_points, difficulty_config, seed)`:
  - RandomNumberGenerator with optional seed
  - Place obstacles based on distance-from-path rules
  - Vary rock/tree ratios and scales

**3. Update ProceduralSlope Scene**:
- Add `@export var difficulty: String = "medium"`
- Add `@export var random_seed: int = -1` (use time if -1)
- Make `slope_data_path` optional (procedural by default)
- Allow JSON override for designer-crafted slopes

**4. Procedural Noise Algorithm** (CURRENT):
```gdscript
# Smooth multi-layer noise for realistic terrain
var noise_amplitudes = config.get("noise_amplitude", [8.0, 4.0, 2.0])
var noise_freqs = config.get("noise_frequencies", [0.005, 0.012, 0.025])

# Create random seed for noise consistency
var noise_seed = hash(str(width_m) + str(length_m))
var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
rng.seed = noise_seed

# Generate FIXED phase offsets once (not per-vertex!)
var phase_offsets = []
for i in range(6):
    phase_offsets.append(rng.randf() * 6.28)

var noise_val = 0.0

# Large-scale terrain features (mountains, valleys) - very slow frequency
noise_val += sin(world_x * noise_freqs[0] + phase_offsets[0]) * cos(world_z * noise_freqs[0] + phase_offsets[1]) * noise_amplitudes[0]

# Medium-scale features (hills, dips) - smooth patterns, 2 layers
noise_val += sin(world_x * noise_freqs[1] + world_z * noise_freqs[1] * 0.5 + phase_offsets[2]) * noise_amplitudes[1]
noise_val += cos(world_x * noise_freqs[1] * 0.7 + world_z * noise_freqs[1] + phase_offsets[3]) * noise_amplitudes[1] * 0.6

# Small-scale details (gentle bumps) - subtle variation, 2 layers
noise_val += sin(world_x * noise_freqs[2] + world_z * noise_freqs[2] * 0.8 + phase_offsets[4]) * noise_amplitudes[2]
noise_val += cos(world_x * noise_freqs[2] * 0.6 + world_z * noise_freqs[2] + phase_offsets[5]) * noise_amplitudes[2] * 0.4

# Note: Micro-detail random noise removed to prevent spiky terrain
```

**Key design decisions**:
- **Fixed phase offsets**: Calculated once before vertex loop, ensures smooth continuous terrain
- **Lower frequencies**: 0.005/0.012/0.025 create wide, gentle features (3x reduction from previous)
- **Reduced amplitudes**: 8m/4m/2m prevent excessive height variation (50% reduction)
- **Simplified multipliers**: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 avoid high-frequency artifacts
- **No random micro-detail**: Removed per-vertex randomness that caused spiky appearance

**5. Procedural Path Curvature**:
```gdscript
var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
rng.seed = seed if seed != -1 else Time.get_ticks_msec()

var path_points = []
var current_x = 0.0
var current_z = 0.0

for i in range(num_segments):
    current_z -= segment_length

    # Apply difficulty-based lateral drift
    var drift = rng.randf_range(-1.0, 1.0) * turn_sharpness * 20.0
    current_x = clamp(current_x + drift, -width_m/2 + 20, width_m/2 - 20)

    var height = calculate_height_at(current_x, current_z)
    path_points.append([current_x, height, current_z])
```

### Benefits
- **Replayability**: Unique terrain every run
- **Balanced Progression**: Easy for learning, Hard for mastery
- **Reproducible**: Optional seed for debugging/sharing specific runs
- **Designer Override**: JSON still works for hand-crafted slopes

## 10) Recent Updates (2025-10-14)

### Update 1: Realistic Slope Sections Implementation (Morning)
**Problem**: Original terrain had uniform linear slope with no variety. Lacked the natural flow of real ski slopes.

**Solution**: Implemented varied slope sections that mimic real ski resort terrain:

1. **Non-linear Base Slope** (`terrain_generator.gd:119-140`):
   - Divided slope into 5 distinct sections based on `slope_progress` (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Each section has unique characteristics:
     * **Gentle starter** (0-25%): Smooth undulation for speed building
     * **First steep drop** (25-40%): Moderate descent using quadratic falloff
     * **Plateau rest area** (40-55%): Gentle rolling for catching breath
     * **Second steep section** (55-70%): Another challenging descent
     * **Jump zone** (70-100%): Gentle bumps for finale

2. **Multi-layer Noise System** (`terrain_generator.gd:142-154`):
   - 6 noise layers with different frequencies and amplitudes
   - Attempted to create natural irregular terrain variation
   - Used random phase offsets and frequency multipliers

**Initial Results**:
- Successfully generates terrain with varied sections
- Creates gameplay pacing variation
- However, terrain appeared too spiky/jagged (see Update 2)

---

### Update 2: Smooth Terrain Fix (Afternoon)
**Problem**: Terrain appeared "spiky like thorns" - sharp, irregular peaks everywhere. Not smooth enough for skiing.

**Root causes identified**:
1. **Per-vertex random phase offsets**: `rng.randf() * 6.28` calculated inside vertex loop
   - Destroyed continuity between adjacent vertices
   - Created jagged, discontinuous surface
2. **Too high frequencies**: 0.015/0.03/0.08 created tight, close-spaced bumps
3. **Too large amplitudes**: 15m/8m/4m excessive height variation
4. **Complex frequency multipliers**: 1.3, 1.7, 2.1 created high-frequency artifacts
5. **Per-vertex random micro-detail**: `(rng.randf() - 0.5) * amplitude` added noise to every vertex
6. **Excessive section variations**: 60m/45m drops too dramatic

**Solution - 6 Key Changes**:

| Aspect | Before (Spiky) | After (Smooth) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Phase Offsets** | `rng.randf()` per vertex | Fixed array, calculated once | Continuous terrain |
| **Frequencies** | [0.015, 0.03, 0.08] | [0.005, 0.012, 0.025] | 3x wider features |
| **Amplitudes** | [15.0, 8.0, 4.0] | [8.0, 4.0, 2.0] | 50% reduction |
| **Freq Multipliers** | 1.3, 1.7, 2.1 | 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 | Simplified, gentler |
| **Micro-detail** | ±0.6m random | Removed entirely | No vertex noise |
| **Section Heights** | ±60m, ±45m | ±30m, ±25m | 50% reduction |

**Code Changes** (`terrain_generator.gd:88-154`):

```gdscript
# CRITICAL FIX: Calculate phase offsets ONCE, not per-vertex
var phase_offsets = []
for i in range(6):
    phase_offsets.append(rng.randf() * 6.28)

# Use FIXED offsets in noise calculation
noise_val += sin(world_x * noise_freqs[0] + phase_offsets[0]) * ...  # Not rng.randf()!
```

**DifficultyConfig Updates** (`difficulty_config.gd`):

```gdscript
Easy:   noise_amplitude=[6.0, 3.0, 1.5],  noise_frequencies=[0.003, 0.008, 0.018]
Medium: noise_amplitude=[8.0, 4.0, 2.0],  noise_frequencies=[0.005, 0.012, 0.025]
Hard:   noise_amplitude=[12.0, 6.0, 3.0], noise_frequencies=[0.008, 0.018, 0.035]
```

**Results**:
- Terrain now smooth and ski-able
- Wide, gentle hills and valleys (not tight bumps)
- Natural mountain appearance maintained
- No spiky artifacts
- Successfully tested with 37,500 vertices

**Lessons Learned**:
- Random values must be fixed outside vertex loops for continuous surfaces
- Lower frequencies (< 0.01) essential for natural-looking terrain
- Per-vertex randomness destroys mesh smoothness
- Moderation in amplitude critical for playable slopes

### Update 3: Sparkling Snow Material (2025-10-15)
**Problem**: Terrain looked dull and didn't capture the luminous, sparkling quality of real snow under sunlight.

**Goal**: Make snow terrain sparkle and glow like real snow on a sunny winter day.

**Solution**: Enhanced StandardMaterial3D properties for snow surface:

**Material Changes** (`terrain_generator.gd:259-268`):

| Property | Before | After | Effect |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| **albedo_color** | `(0.95, 0.95, 1.0)` | `(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)` | Pure white for brighter snow |
| **roughness** | `0.7` | `0.3` | Smooth surface for reflective sparkle |
| **emission_enabled** | `false` | `true` | Enable self-illumination |
| **emission** | N/A | `Color(0.15, 0.15, 0.2)` | Subtle blue-white glow |
| **emission_energy_multiplier** | N/A | `0.5` | Gentle luminance intensity |

**Code Implementation**:
```gdscript
# Create material with sparkling snow properties
var material = StandardMaterial3D.new()
material.albedo_color = Color(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)  # Pure white for bright snow
material.roughness = 0.3  # Smooth surface for reflective sparkle
material.metallic = 0.0
material.emission_enabled = true
material.emission = Color(0.15, 0.15, 0.2)  # Subtle blue-white glow
material.emission_energy_multiplier = 0.5  # Gentle emission
material.shading_mode = BaseMaterial3D.SHADING_MODE_PER_PIXEL
array_mesh.surface_set_material(0, material)
```

**Visual Results**:
- ✨ **Sparkle Effect**: Lower roughness (0.3) creates smooth, reflective surface that catches light
- 💎 **Bright Snow**: Pure white albedo maximizes light reflection
- 🌟 **Self-Illumination**: Subtle emission simulates snow's natural luminosity
- ❄️ **Cold Atmosphere**: Blue-white emission tint conveys winter coldness
- 🏔️ **Natural Glow**: Gentle emission energy (0.5) prevents over-brightness

**Lighting Integration**:
Works in conjunction with DirectionalLight3D settings (from earlier update):
- `light_energy = 1.5` - Strong sunlight
- `shadow_enabled = true` - Depth and contrast
- `shadow_opacity = 0.6` - Soft shadows

**Technical Notes**:
- Emission is view-independent, provides consistent glow from all angles
- Low roughness increases specular highlights under directional light
- Per-pixel shading ensures smooth light falloff across terrain
- No performance impact - material properties are GPU-efficient

**Design Rationale**:
Real snow sparkles due to ice crystal reflection and scattering. The combination of:
1. High albedo (brightness)
2. Low roughness (smoothness)
3. Subtle emission (self-glow)

...simulates this natural phenomenon in a low-poly, stylized way that matches the game's aesthetic.

## 11) Player-Terrain Collision Setup

### Collision Layers

**Purpose**: Define which objects can collide with each other in the physics system.

**Configuration**:
- **Player**: `collision_mask = 2` (detects Environment layer)
- **Terrain**: `collision_layer = 2` (Environment layer)

**Implementation** (`terrain_generator.gd:242-244`):
```gdscript
# Set collision layers for terrain
static_body.collision_layer = 2  # Environment layer
static_body.collision_mask = 0   # Terrain doesn't need to detect anything
```

### Terrain Collision Position

**Critical Height Adjustment**:
- **Visual terrain**: Original height (as generated by heightmap)
- **Collision surface**: Y+0.5 (50cm above visual surface)
- **Result**: Player floats 50cm above visual terrain

**Why This Works**:
1. Player collision capsule positioned at Y=0.4 (see PLAYER.md)
2. Terrain collision raised by Y=0.5
3. Combined offset prevents ski clipping through snow
4. Visual appearance: skis naturally rest on snow surface

**Implementation** (`terrain_generator.gd` and `procedural_slope.gd`):
```gdscript
# Terrain collision shape raised
collision_shape.position.y = 0.5

# Player positioned above terrain start point
var player_start = Vector3(start_point.x, start_point.y + 5.0, start_point.z - 10.0)
```

### Physics Layer Interaction

| Object | Collision Layer | Collision Mask | Detects |
|--------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Player** | 1 (Player) | 2 (Environment) | Terrain, obstacles |
| **Terrain** | 2 (Environment) | 0 (None) | Nothing (static) |
| **Obstacles** | 2 (Environment) | 0 (None) | Nothing (static) |

**Result**: Player can detect and collide with terrain and obstacles, but terrain/obstacles don't interact with each other.

### Debug & Verification

**Terrain Boundary Markers** (`terrain_generator.gd:282-292`):
- Red sphere markers at four corners
- Helps visualize terrain extent
- Verifies terrain coverage around player start

**Console Logging**:
```
Heightmap generated: 201 x 751 cells
Built terrain mesh with 37500 faces
```

---

## 12) Player Movement Implementation

**File**: `scripts/player/player.gd` (CharacterBody3D)

### Core Control Scheme

**Rotation-Based Movement** (not strafe):
- **Left/Right (A/D)**: Y-axis rotation (turning) only - no lateral movement
- **Forward (W)**: Accelerate in facing direction
- **Back (S)**: Brake to stop (does not reverse)

### Key Systems

#### 1. Slope-Based Gradual Acceleration

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `MAX_SPEED` | 15.0 | Maximum forward speed |
| `TURN_SPEED` | 1.5 | Rotation speed (reduced for control) |
| `ACCELERATION` | 5.0 | Base acceleration on flat ground |
| `SLOPE_ACCELERATION_FACTOR` | 0.5 | Slope angle multiplier |
| `FRICTION` | 2.0 | Natural slowdown when coasting |

**Acceleration Logic** (`player.gd:114-133`):
- Calculate slope angle from `get_floor_normal()`
- Steeper slopes = faster acceleration
- Speed builds gradually from 0 to `MAX_SPEED`
- Forward key required to accelerate (no passive downhill)

#### 2. Low-Speed Skating Animation

**When**: `current_speed < 4.0` and moving forward
**Effect**: Alternating push motion

| Phase | Left Leg | Right Leg | Left Ski Angle | Right Ski Angle |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0.0-0.5 | Pushes out (0.15→0.30) | Center (0.15) | +20° | 0° |
| 0.5-1.0 | Center (0.15) | Pushes out (0.15→0.30) | 0° | -20° |

**Implementation** (`_update_skating_animation()`, lines 248-281):
- `skating_phase` cycles 0.0 → 1.0 continuously
- Push intensity follows `sin(phase * PI)` curve (smooth 0→1→0)
- Transitions to parallel stance when speed >= 4.0

#### 3. Braking System

**Back Key Behavior**:
- Decelerates at `BRAKE_DECELERATION = 10.0 m/s²`
- Does NOT move backward
- Stops at zero speed

**Brake Animations**:
- Legs widen (0.15 → 0.25 spacing)
- Skis angle inward 15° (pizza/wedge)
- Body leans back -15°

#### 4. Body Tilt & Lean

**Automatic Animations**:
- **Tilt** (roll): ±30° based on turn input (left/right)
- **Lean** (pitch): +20° forward / -15° brake / 0° neutral
- Smooth `lerp()` interpolation at `ANIMATION_SPEED = 10.0`

### Input Mapping

| Action | Keys | Effect |
|--------|------|--------|
| `move_forward` | W / ↑ | Accelerate |
| `move_back` | S / ↓ | Brake (no reverse) |
| `move_left` | A / ← | Turn left |
| `move_right` | D / → | Turn right |
| `jump` | Space | Jump (when grounded) |
| `toggle_camera` | F1 | Cycle camera modes |

### Physics & Collision

- **Player**: `collision_mask = 2` (detects environment)
- **Terrain**: `collision_layer = 2` (static environment)
- **Gravity**: Applied when `!is_on_floor()`
- **Movement**: `move_and_slide()` with collision response

### Implementation Notes

**Camera Mode Control** (lines 68-69):
- Modes 0-2 (3rd/1st person): Movement **enabled**
- Mode 3 (free camera): Movement **disabled** (inspection only)

**Skating vs Braking Priority**:
- Braking overrides skating animation
- Skating only active at low speed with forward input
- High-speed transitions smoothly to parallel stance

## 13) Advanced Features

### Snow Sparkle Shader

**File**: `resources/shaders/snow_sparkle.gdshader`

**Purpose**: Enhanced snow material with view-dependent sparkle effects, density mapping for compacted paths, and natural winter atmosphere.

**Key Features**:

1. **PBR-Like Parameters**:
   - `base_color`: Slightly warm white `(0.98, 0.98, 0.96)`
   - `roughness`: 0.85 for grazing highlights
   - `normal_intensity`: 0.2 for micro-roughness of packed snow
   - `metallic`: 0.0 (snow is non-metallic)

2. **Sparkle System**:
   - `sparkle_intensity`: 0.0-2.0 (default 0.3)
   - `sparkle_scale`: Grid size for sparkle points (1.0-100.0, default 20.0)
   - `sparkle_threshold`: Brightness cutoff (0.0-1.0, default 0.85)
   - **View-dependent**: Sparkles only appear at grazing angles (0.3-0.7 view angle)
   - **Grid-based noise**: Hash function creates random sparkle per grid cell
   - **Circular shape**: Smooth falloff for each sparkle point

3. **Density Mapping**:
   - `density_map`: Texture showing compacted snow paths (darker areas)
   - `density_strength`: 0.0-1.0 (default 0.3) - how much darker compacted areas become
   - Applied multiplicatively to base color: `mix(1.0, 0.85, density * strength)`

4. **Normal Mapping**:
   - `normal_map`: For micro-roughness variation
   - `NORMAL_MAP_DEPTH`: Controlled by `normal_intensity` parameter

5. **Emission**:
   - Subtle blue-white glow: `vec3(0.15, 0.15, 0.2) * 0.5`
   - Simulates snow's natural luminosity under sunlight

**Shader Implementation Highlights**:

```glsl
float hash(vec2 p) {
    return fract(sin(dot(p, vec2(127.1, 311.7))) * 43758.5453123);
}

float sparkle_noise(vec2 uv, vec3 view_dir, vec3 normal) {
    float view_angle = dot(view_dir, normal);
    float angle_factor = smoothstep(0.3, 0.7, abs(view_angle));

    vec2 grid_uv = uv * sparkle_scale;
    vec2 grid_id = floor(grid_uv);
    float sparkle = smoothstep(sparkle_threshold, 1.0, hash(grid_id));

    float dist = length(fract(grid_uv) - 0.5);
    float shape = 1.0 - smoothstep(0.2, 0.5, dist);

    return sparkle * shape * angle_factor;
}
```

**Visual Result**: Sunlit snow shows subtle sparkle when viewed at grazing angles, with darker compacted paths where players frequently travel.

## 14) Enhanced Terrain Material

### Snow Surface Properties

**Goal**: Create realistic snow-covered mountain terrain with visible thickness and sparkle under sunlight.

**Material Configuration** (`terrain_generator.gd`):

| Property | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Base Color** | `#FAFAF6` (slightly warm white) | Natural snow appearance |
| **Roughness** | `0.85` | Diffuse surface with subtle highlights |
| **Emission** | `Color(0.15, 0.15, 0.2)` | Subtle blue-white glow |
| **Emission Energy** | `0.5` | Gentle self-illumination |

### Lighting Setup

**DirectionalLight3D ("Sun")**:
- **Elevation**: 55°
- **Azimuth**: 30°
- **Shadow Enabled**: `true`
- **Soft Shadows**: Enabled
- **Light Energy**: `1.5` (strong sunlight)
- **Shadow Opacity**: `0.6` (soft, natural shadows)

**Sky Configuration**:
- **Type**: ProceduralSky
- **Ambient Tint**: Bluish (cold atmosphere)
- **Horizon Color**: `Color(0.64625, 0.65575, 0.67075)`

**Visual Effect**:
- Snow sparkles at grazing angles under sunlight
- Subtle blue-white emission simulates natural snow luminosity
- Low roughness creates reflective, icy surface appearance
- Soft shadows add depth and realism

### Obstacle System

**See**: [OBSTACLES.md](OBSTACLES.md) for complete obstacle system documentation.

**Quick Reference**:
- Scene-based obstacles with physics collision
- Player-proximity spawning (70m radius)
- Density modes: Sparse (2), Normal (10), Dense (20)
- 3D labels for obstacle identification
- Physics raycast-based terrain snapping

### Ski Tracks System

**File**: `scripts/player/ski_tracks.gd`

**Purpose**: Visual trail system that creates persistent ski marks on snow using Decal projection.

**Key Features**:

1. **Decal-Based Rendering**:
   - Projects tracks onto terrain surface from above
   - Each track is a `Decal` node positioned at ski contact point
   - Size: 0.15m wide × 1.2m long
   - Position: 5cm above ground to prevent z-fighting

2. **Track Creation**:
   - `track_spacing`: Minimum 0.5m between tracks (prevents overlap)
   - Tracks only created when `player.is_on_floor()` and moving
   - Rotation matches player yaw for directional accuracy
   - Track texture: Gradient (darker in center, lighter at edges)

3. **Fade-Out System**:
   - `track_lifetime`: 90 seconds (configurable)
   - Alpha fade from 1.0 → 0.0 over lifetime
   - Tracks automatically removed when expired
   - Max 200 active tracks (`max_tracks`)
   - Oldest tracks removed first when limit reached

4. **Visual Appearance**:
   - Color: Dark compacted snow `(0.7, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8)`
   - Texture: Simple gradient alpha channel
   - Blend mode: TRANSPARENCY_ALPHA
   - Upper/lower fade: 0.1 for smooth blending with terrain

5. **Performance**:
   - Lightweight Decal nodes (GPU-efficient projection)
   - Automatic cleanup prevents memory buildup
   - Track count signal for debugging/UI display

**API**:

```gdscript
# Configure in editor
@export var player: CharacterBody3D
@export var max_tracks := 200
@export var track_spacing := 0.5
@export var track_lifetime := 90.0
@export var track_width := 0.15
@export var track_length := 1.2

# Runtime control
ski_tracks.clear_tracks()  # Remove all tracks
ski_tracks.set_track_lifetime(120.0)  # Change fade time
var count = ski_tracks.get_track_count()  # Current active tracks

# Signal when tracks update
ski_tracks.tracks_updated.connect(_on_tracks_updated)
```

**Implementation Details**:

```gdscript
func _create_track_decal(pos: Vector3, yaw: float) -> void:
    var decal = Decal.new()
    decal.global_position = pos + Vector3(0, 0.05, 0)  # Slightly above ground
    decal.rotation.y = yaw  # Match ski direction
    decal.rotation.x = deg_to_rad(-90)  # Project downward
    decal.size = Vector3(track_width, track_length, 1.0)
    decal.texture_albedo = _create_track_texture()
    decal.modulate = Color(0.7, 0.7, 0.75, 1.0)
    decal.upper_fade = 0.1
    decal.lower_fade = 0.1
    add_child(decal)
```

**Update Logic**:

```gdscript
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
    if player and player.is_on_floor():
        var distance_moved = player.global_position.distance_to(last_track_position)
        if distance_moved >= track_spacing:
            _create_track_decal(player.global_position, player.rotation.y)
            last_track_position = player.global_position

    _update_tracks(delta)  # Fade and remove expired tracks
```

**Design Rationale**:
- Decal approach chosen over dynamic texture for simplicity and flexibility
- 90-second lifetime balances visual persistence with memory management
- Gradient texture creates realistic ski compression appearance
- Position offset prevents z-fighting with terrain mesh
